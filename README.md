# Coffee Machine Project

A beginner Python project that simulates a coffee machine!  
It checks if there are enough ingredients, processes coins, and serves the drink the user chooses.  

Built as part of the *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp* on Udemy ☕ — learned a lot about functions, logic, and user interaction.
